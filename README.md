# Mongo API Project

This is my second api project. I used music data to make some endpoints using mongoose.

## Features

- 4 different endpoints using mongoose methods like find, findById and gt.
- Endpoints that return a collection of results: endpoints, tracks and danceability.
- error handling by returning 404 and 400 status and a error message.

## The problem

If i had more time i would get another data set to work with and make a front to my backend. I would love to to pagination, but thats for next project.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
