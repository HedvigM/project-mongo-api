# Mongo API Project

This is my second api project. I used music data to make some endpoints using mongoose.

## Features

- 4 different endpoints using mongoose methods like find, findById and gt.
- Endpoints that return a collection of results: endpoints, tracks and danceability.
- error handling by returning 404 and 400 status and a error message.

## The problem

If i had more time i would get another data set to work with and make a front to my backend. I would love to to pagination, but thats for next project.
